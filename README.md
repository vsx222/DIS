## How to run and interact with your web-app?
When the web app is running:

* The app automatically selects a random celebrity as the target.

* You begin by asking questions and receiving answers to help narrow down the possible options.

* You can visually eliminate celebrities who no longer match the traits — just like in the classic “Guess Who?” game.

* When you are confident, enter a name in the “Guess Celebrity” input field. You’ll be told immediately whether your guess is correct or not.

* Click “Restart Game” at any time to reset the game, clear guesses, and start fresh with a new mysterious celebrity.

* Every guess you make is stored and displayed on the page for easy tracking.
